# Engineering Playbook

This is my personal collection of engineering practices, architectural notes, design decisions, and workflow templates.  
It's the playbook I use daily as a backend engineer to build and maintain reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.

Here you'll find:

- ✅ Pull request templates with acceptance criteria and risk analysis
- ✅ Interview preparation materials (Java, architecture, system design)
- ✅ Checklists for reviewing code, refactoring, and planning features
- ✅ Design patterns and trade-offs applied in real-world projects
- ✅ Thoughts on clean code, testing strategy, and delivery flow

> **Disclaimer:** This playbook reflects my personal engineering standards and thinking.  
> It evolves with experience and is intended as a living document.
